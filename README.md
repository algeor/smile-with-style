# WIND Statistics inspired by  SciPy 2019 Tutorial's task 'Wind Statistics'

I do not own th task, neither the datasets.
Original repo:
https://github.com/enthought/Numpy-Tutorial-SciPyConf-2019

I have redesigned the idea, transforming the data into dat frames and plots (only 2 by far).
To be updated.
